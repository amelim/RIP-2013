ISSUES:

1/11/2006 - Did not compile under g++ 4.0.2-8


*****************************************

Note: in process of fixing everything else I deleted some of the WIN32
comments needed by MS Visual C++, so cannot generate a native binary.

1/4/03 - the -O2 or -O3 flags break the parser!  gives error
message, "strips  not supported".

Also: parser in lex.yy.cpp was printing
of ^M's right after loading the files.   Fixed
this by commenting out call to ECHO.

Should try again after installing lex and bison, to see if get the
same problems.


*****************************************

1/4/03 - All bugs fixed!

1/3/03 - dumps core on gettimeofday call in graphplan
1/3/03 - note that current version of g++ in cygwin does NOT set
WIN32.

1/3/03 - need to install bison and flex on laptob, weren't installed with cygwin
for some reason!  Commented out sections in makefile that use them.

12/28/01 - the graphplan search code causes a core dump.
Runs okay if graphplan is not used as a solver.  Should
recompile without -O3 and -g and use gdb.  FIXED!

2/3/02 - 
Dumps core under cygwin on the large bw wffs.  This happens right
   after:

** Turning off completeness check **
Converting graph to wff
number of action variables = 13939
number of fluent variables = 5219
total number variables = 19158
BASH: [512: 1] tcsetattr: Not a character device
Segmentation fault (core dumped)

This happens whether the solver is Chaff, satz, or walksat.  So this
looks to be a bug in the interface code, not in the solvers
themselves.

Dec 2001 - Changes to make compile under Cygwin.
Probably will also help compile under Linux 6.1.

1. In make Makefile Cygin not finding -lfl library OR -ll library.
   However, they are not need under Cygwin.

ifeq ($(OSTYPE), cygwin)
  PFLAGS =
endif

2. The OSTYPE environmental variable needs to be set to cygwin.  Do
   this is .bashrc or .cshrc, etc.

3. In rel_sat_r/Random.cpp, changed

#ifdef LINUX
extern "C" {
  int initstate();
  int setstate();
}
#endif

to

#ifndef WIN32
...

All the calls to initstate() and setstate() are wrapped in #ifndef
WIN32, so I'm guessing this is correct in general (but have not
verified).

4. In zchaff/Makefile must comment out the following:

# Following seemingly harmless code breaks this Makefile UNLESS your
# shell is csh!  Go figure!!!
#  ifneq (posix, $(OSTYPE))
#  ifneq (linux, $(OSTYPE))
#  echo "WARNING This thing are not tested under os other than Linux and Solaris"
#  endif
#  endif

5. Found bug in graphplan.cpp - must change
	    sscanf(argv[++i], "%f", &bb_maxsec);
to
	    sscanf(argv[++i], "%d", &bb_maxsec);
