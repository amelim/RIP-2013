    %
    An overview of the numerical results is given in Table \ref{table:results}. We compared two planners, namely Fast Forward and BlackBox. 

        \begin{itemize}
     \item BlackBox (uses GraphPlan and SAT - see \cite{Blackbox})
     
%      Blackbox is a planning system that works by converting problems specified in STRIPS notation into Boolean satisfiability problems, and then solving the problems with a variety of state-of-the-art satisfiability engines. The front-end employs the graphplan system (Blum and Furst 1995). There is extreme flexibility in specifying the engines to use. For example, you can tell it to use walksat (Selman, Kautz, and Cohen 1994) for 60 seconds, and if that fails, then satz (Li and Anbulagan 1997) for 1000 seconds. This gives blackbox the capability of functioning efficiently over a broad range of problems. The name blackbox refers to the fact that the plan generator knows nothing about the SAT solvers, and the SAT solvers know nothing about plans: each is a "black box" to the other.
     \item Fast Forward (see \cite{FastForward})
     
%      FF is a forward chaining heuristic state space planner. The main heuristic principle was originally developed by Blai Bonet and Hector Geffner for the HSP system: to obtain a heuristic estimate, relax the task P at hand into a simpler task P+ by ignoring the delete lists of all operators. While HSP employs a technique that gives a rough estimate for the solution length of P+ , FF extracts an explicit solution to P+ , by using a GRAPHPLAN-style algorithm. The number of actions in the relaxed solutions is used as a goal distance estimate. These estimates control a novel local search strategy, enforced hill-climbing: this is a hill-climbing procedure that, in each intermediate state, uses breadth first search to find a strictly better, possibly indirect, successor. As a second important heuristic information, the relaxed plans can be used to prune the search space: usually, the actions that are really useful in a state are contained in the relaxed plan, so one can restrict the successors of any state to those produced by members of the respective relaxed solution. FF employs a slightly more elaborated form of this heuristic, which we call helpful actions pruning. The simple architecture described so far already solves most of the available benchmarks extremely efficiently. Problematic cases are when there are dead ends --- states from which the goals get unreachable --- or goal orderings. In the presence of the latter phenomenon, like in the Blocksworld, the local search sometimes proceeds too greedily, and gets trapped. To overcome this, we have integrated the Goal Agenda algorithm (first proposed by Jana Koehler), as well as a simple goal ordering technique of our own, based on the relaxed solutions. In order to deal with dead end states, which can cause the search to fail entirely, we have chosen a simple safety-net solution: if local search fails, then we skip everything done so far and switch to a complete best-first algorithm that simply expands all search nodes by increasing order of goal distance evaluation.

 \item \textbf{Clearly PDDL was not intended for this sort of application. Discuss the challenges in expressing geometric constraints in semantic planning.}
  \begin{itemize}
   \item PDDL can't handle continuous worlds, the world has to be discretized.
   \item There is no inherent notion of adjacency or neighborhood. Such relations have to be expressed explicitly. E.g. if squares are used, for each square PDDL requires 4 adjacency clauses.
   \item In PDDL each square has to be given a label instead of just saying if the robot moves one step to the right, its x-coordinate increased by one. This leads to a large amount of labels and adjacency relationships in the problem description.
   \item It needs to be explicitly stated whether a square is empty or contains a box or robot in order to detect an obstacle. Each action taken must ensure to update the 'empty' property of a square. This is a classical manifestation of the frame problem.
   \item Even for small problem instances as the ones shown in the examples it was too tedious to write down the PDDL instantiation by hand. What could be described easily as a matrix required roughly 100 lines of PDDL code. 
  \end{itemize}

 \item \textbf{In many cases, geometric and dynamic planning are insufficient to describe a domain. Give
an example of a problem that is best suited for semantic (classical) planning. Explain why a
semantic representation would be desirable.}
  \begin{itemize}
   \item Clearly, geometric constraints can't be efficiently expressed in PDDL. Therefore, all problem types that have a physical interpretation and an embodiment in a physical and geometric world are not well suited for PDDL. Domains with geometric constraints that encode for example positions of objects or distances between objects (in continuous or discrete space) are best handled by geometric planners. 
   \item Problems that represent an abstract world, however, where neither states nor actions are tied to a geometric interpretation of the world are well suited for PDDL and classical semantic planning. In these types of problems dimensions/size of objects do not matter and actions are not tied to geometric constraints. In this case constraints define the abstract rules of the domain rather than a geometric setup. 
   \item A very classic problem in semantic planning is for example the 'change tire problem' (see \cite{Russell2010}) that describes how to change a flat tire on a car. The \textit{move} action moves objects from one abstract location to another (e.g. from the trunk to an axle). These locations hold no geometric information and are essentially just labels for objects in the world. The dimensions of objects do not matter either. Such a domain where the problem has been abstracted away from the geometric constraints are well-suited for a semantic description such as PDDL.
