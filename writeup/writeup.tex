\begin{enumerate}
 \item \textbf{Show successful plans from at least one planner on the three Sokoban problems in Figure 2
(1-3). The challenge problem is optional.}
  The plans for problem 2.1 to 2.3 as well as the challenge problem are shown in the appendix.
 \item \textbf{Compare the performance of two planners on this domain. Which one works better? Does this
make sense, why?} \newline
    %
    An overview of the numerical results is given in Table \ref{table:results}. We compared three planners, namely Fast Forward (FF), Conformant-FF, and BlackBox. FF and Conformant-FF seem to use a very similar underlying architecture while BlackBox relies on a different representation of the problem as a satisfiability problem.
    
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{BlackBox (see \cite{Blackbox})}: BlackBox converts the PDDL description of the problem into a Boolean satisfiability problem and solves it using a variety of satisfiability engines. The front-end of BlackBox relies on the Graphplan system.
      \item \textbf{Fast Forward (see \cite{FastForward})}: FF is a forward chaining heuristic state space planner. The heuristic relaxes the task at hand into a simpler task by ignoring the delete list of all operators. That relaxed problem is solved using a GraphPlan-style algorithm and the solution to the relaxed problem is used as heuristic to guide the search. The relaxed plans are also used to prune the search space.
%      FF is a forward chaining heuristic state space planner. The main heuristic principle was originally developed by Blai Bonet and Hector Geffner for the HSP system: to obtain a heuristic estimate, relax the task P at hand into a simpler task P+ by ignoring the delete lists of all operators. While HSP employs a technique that gives a rough estimate for the solution length of P+ , FF extracts an explicit solution to P+ , by using a GRAPHPLAN-style algorithm. The number of actions in the relaxed solutions is used as a goal distance estimate. These estimates control a novel local search strategy, enforced hill-climbing: this is a hill-climbing procedure that, in each intermediate state, uses breadth first search to find a strictly better, possibly indirect, successor. As a second important heuristic information, the relaxed plans can be used to prune the search space: usually, the actions that are really useful in a state are contained in the relaxed plan, so one can restrict the successors of any state to those produced by members of the respective relaxed solution. FF employs a slightly more elaborated form of this heuristic, which we call helpful actions pruning. The simple architecture described so far already solves most of the available benchmarks extremely efficiently. Problematic cases are when there are dead ends --- states from which the goals get unreachable --- or goal orderings. In the presence of the latter phenomenon, like in the Blocksworld, the local search sometimes proceeds too greedily, and gets trapped. To overcome this, we have integrated the Goal Agenda algorithm (first proposed by Jana Koehler), as well as a simple goal ordering technique of our own, based on the relaxed solutions. In order to deal with dead end states, which can cause the search to fail entirely, we have chosen a simple safety-net solution: if local search fails, then we skip everything done so far and switch to a complete best-first algorithm that simply expands all search nodes by increasing order of goal distance evaluation.
    \end{itemize}
    
    As expected (see Table \ref{table:results}), FF and Conformant-FF achieve much better results and generally solve the problems in much shorter times. BlackBox takes orders of magnitude longer and fails to compute plans for problems that take more than 25 steps to solve (i.e. the solver times out). The number of steps BlackBox can handle seems to be fairly low. The first up to 20 levels of the graph are computed fairly fast, but any level in the GraphPlan graph after that take on the order of seconds or minutes. Clearly the number of levels is too low to solve a Sokoban level like the ones shown in problem 2.2 to 2.4. \\
    It seems that, unlike FF, BlackBox does not use any heuristic to prune the search tree or search in a more goal-directed fashion. FF prunes large parts of the search space using the heuristic described above, which allows FF to handle much larger problem instances and compute a plan much faster.

 \item \textbf{Clearly PDDL was not intended for this sort of application. Discuss the challenges in expressing geometric constraints in semantic planning.}
  \begin{itemize}
   \item PDDL can't handle continuous worlds, the world has to be discretized.
   \item There is no inherent notion of adjacency or neighborhood. Such relations have to be expressed explicitly. E.g. if squares are used, for each square PDDL requires 4 adjacency clauses.
   \item In PDDL each square has to be given a label instead of just saying if the robot moves one step to the right, its x-coordinate increased by one. This leads to a large amount of labels and adjacency relationships in the problem description.
   \item It needs to be explicitly stated whether a square is empty or contains a box or robot in order to detect an obstacle. Each action taken must ensure to update the 'empty' property of a square. This is a classical manifestation of the frame problem.
   \item Even for small problem instances as the ones shown in the examples it was too tedious to write down the PDDL instantiation by hand. What could be described easily as a matrix required roughly 100 lines of PDDL code. 
  \end{itemize}

 \item \textbf{In many cases, geometric and dynamic planning are insufficient to describe a domain. Give
an example of a problem that is best suited for semantic (classical) planning. Explain why a
semantic representation would be desirable.}
  \begin{itemize}
   \item Clearly, geometric constraints can't be efficiently expressed in PDDL. Therefore, all problem types that have a physical interpretation and an embodiment in a physical and geometric world are not well suited for PDDL. Domains with geometric constraints that encode for example positions of objects or distances between objects (in continuous or discrete space) are best handled by geometric planners. 
   \item Problems that represent an abstract world, however, where neither states nor actions are tied to a geometric interpretation of the world are well suited for PDDL and classical semantic planning. In these types of problems dimensions/size of objects do not matter and actions are not tied to geometric constraints. In this case constraints define the abstract rules of the domain rather than a geometric setup. 
   \item A very classic problem in semantic planning is for example the 'change tire problem' (see \cite{Russell2010}) that describes how to change a flat tire on a car. The \textit{move} action moves objects from one abstract location to another (e.g. from the trunk to an axle). These locations hold no geometric information and are essentially just labels for objects in the world. The dimensions of objects do not matter either. Such a domain where the problem has been abstracted away from the geometric constraints are well-suited for a semantic description such as PDDL.

Our results (see Table \ref{table:results2}) show that our current implementation of the A* algorithm could use improvement in order to improve the efficiency of our algorithm. While the code can solve the simple problems fairly efficiently, the time to find a solution grows quite significantly as the difficult of the problem grows. However, our solution does actually find high quality solutions on par with FF and Conformant-FF. \\

\problem{4}{Post-Project: Towers of Hanoi Revisited}
\label{sec:problem_4}
% ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\begin{enumerate}
 \item \textbf{Give successful plans from at least one planner with 6 and 10 disks.} \newline The solution for both the 6 disk and 10 disk problem were solved using FF. The 6 disk solution took 0.00 seconds to compute and was solved in 63 steps. The 10 disk solution took 0.36 seconds to compute and was solved in 1023 steps. The 6 disk solution is provided in the appendix. Both the 6 disk and 10 disk solution are attached in the .zip submission
 \item \textbf{Do you notice anything about the structure of the plans? Can you use this to increase the
efficiency of planning for Towers of Hanoi? Explain.} \newline
   The plans were very repetitive. For instance, the plan for 10 disks contains in some form a similar plan for 6 disks multiple times throughout the entire solution. This is because in order to move the next largest disk off of the pole, another pole needs to be completely empty. This scenario requires all smaller sized disks to be stacked on the third pole in the correct order. The most efficient way for this to occur is to reuse the solution already created. In general, in order to improve the logic of the plan it would be efficient to group these steps into sub plans that can be reexecuted quickly. There would need to be some reasoning to determine which pole to move to first, but after that the rest of the movements are predetermined. 
 \item \textbf{In a paragraph or two, explain a general planning strategy that would take advantage of
problem structure. Make sure your strategy applies to problems other than Towers of Hanoi.
Would such a planner still be complete?}
+\newline One possible strategy would be to create a planner that could self expand. For instance, it could state with a single disk tower of hanoi, moving from pole x to pole z. Then solve a 2 disk game moving a stacked tower on pole x to a stacked tower on pole z. This program would continually iterate and hopefully through some form of machine learning detect repeatedly grouped steps. For instance, the optimal steps for moving a 2 disk stack from pole x to pole y: move-stack(disk2,pole-x,pole-y) can be simplified to 3 substeps: move(disk1,pole.x,pole.z), move (disk2,pole.x,pole.y),move(disk1,pole.z,pole.y). The next move-stack action \- move-stack (disk3,pole.x,pole.y) would simply involve \- move-stack (disk2,pole.x,pole.z), \- move (disk3,pole.x,pole.y), \- move-stack (disk2,pole.z,pole.y). Hopefully this program would be able to detect other progressively complex tasks that require similar recursion methods.
